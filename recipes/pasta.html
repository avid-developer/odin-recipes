    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 1/4 tsp active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 tsp sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup warm water</li>
        <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>1/2 cup marinara sauce</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>Assorted toppings (e.g. pepperoni, mushrooms, bell peppers)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a small bowl, combine the yeast, sugar, and warm water. Let sit for 5-10 minutes, or until foamy.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the flour and salt. Add the yeast mixture and olive oil, and stir until a dough forms.</li>
        <li>Knead the dough on a floured surface for 5-7 minutes, or until smooth and elastic. Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover with a clean towel, and let rise for 1-2 hours, or until doubled in size.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 450°F (230°C). Punch down the dough, then roll it out on a floured surface to your desired thickness.</li>
        <li>Transfer the dough to a greased baking sheet, then top with marinara sauce, cheese, and your favorite toppings.</li>
        <li>Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly. Slice, serve, and enjoy!
