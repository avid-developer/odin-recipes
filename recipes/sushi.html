    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups sushi rice</li>
        <li>2 1/2 cups water</li>
        <li>1/2 cup rice vinegar</li>
        <li>1/4 cup sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>Nori seaweed sheets</li>
        <li>Sushi-grade fish (e.g. tuna, salmon, yellowtail)</li>
        <li>Assorted vegetables (e.g. cucumber, avocado, carrot)</li>
        <li>Soy sauce, wasabi, and pickled ginger for serving</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse the sushi rice in a fine-mesh strainer until the water runs clear. Combine the rice and water in a rice cooker or pot, and cook according to the manufacturer's instructions.</li>
        <li>In a small saucepan, combine the rice vinegar, sugar, and salt. Heat over low heat until the sugar dissolves. Remove from heat and let cool.</li>
        <li>Transfer the cooked rice to a large bowl and gently fold in the vinegar mixture. Let the rice cool to room temperature.</li>
        <li>Place a sheet of nori on a bamboo sushi mat, shiny side down. Wet your hands and spread a thin layer of rice over the nori, leaving a 1-inch border at the top.</li>
        <li>Arrange your desired fillings (fish, vegetables) in a line across the center of the rice. Roll the sushi tightly using the bamboo mat, sealing the edge with a bit of water.</li>
        <li>Cut the sushi roll into bite-sized pieces using a sharp knife. Serve with soy sauce, wasabi, and pickled ginger. Enjoy!
